Welcome to the front-end page of **Moodle**, the user interface of a mobile application that detects user emotions through updates/status on their social networking profiles. For more information on back-end, server-side development of Moodle, visit [moodle-backend](https://github.com/zhilinwang/moodle-backend) page.

Right now, Moodle has not been released for use on mobile devices. To develop Moodle or test it on your mobile device, you must have [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org) and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) installed. Stay tuned for further releases on official iOS and Android app stores.

## Features
<ul>
<li>iOS and Android support</li>
<li>Simple user interface with easy-navigation and visual appeal (transitions, Flat UI, pretty pictures!)</li>
<li>Secure connection to social media sites with OAuth2</li>
<li>Fast registration with Moodle's server</li>
<li>Written with future extensions in mind</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started

To develop Moodle, download and install [Intel XDK](http://xdk-software.intel.com) or use your favorite mobile app development environment.

To test Moodle on an emulator or to deploy onto a physical mobile device, make sure you have [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org) and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) installed, start a new project, and copy the contents in this repo into the www directory.

For more detailed instructions on how to setup Moodle front-end for testing, please refer to the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/zhilinwang/moodle-frontend/wiki/Setup-Guide).
